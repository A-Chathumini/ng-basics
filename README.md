# ng-basics
Inspired by Angular-Getting Started Course ["Angular: Getting Started"](http://bit.ly/Angular-GettingStarted) course on Pluralsight.

## INSTALLING THE CODE

The following are detailed instructions for installing the code so you can code along with the course.

0) Ensure you have node installed.

   At a command prompt, type `node -v` to ensure you have version `10.16.0` or higher before proceeding.

1) Download or clone the code from this repository.

   If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2) Navigate to the app root folder

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3) In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type `npm install`.

   This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.
   
4) In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type `npm start`.

   The application should then compile and launch in your default browser.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
